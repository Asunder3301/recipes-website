            <h2>Ingredients:</h2>
            <ul>
                <li><b>Butter:</b> This classic chocolate chip cookie recipe starts with two sticks of butter creamed with white and brown sugars. The blend of sugars creates a perfectly balanced flavor.</li>
                <li><b>Eggs:</b> Eggs add moisture and act as a binding agent, which means they help hold the dough together.</li>
                <li><b>Vanilla:</b> Vanilla extract enhances the overall flavor of the chocolate chip cookies.</li>
                <li><b>Baking soda:</b> Baking soda acts as a leavener, which means it helps the cookies rise.</li>
                <li><b>Water:</b> A bit of hot water creates steam as it bakes, working with the baking soda to puff the cookies up.</li>
                <li><b>Salt:</b> A pinch of salt enhances the flavors of the other ingredients, but it won't make the cookies taste salty.</li>
                <li><b>Flour:</b> All-purpose flour helps create gluten, which adds structure to the cookie dough.</li>
                <li><b>Chocolate chips:</b> Of course, you'll need semisweet chocolate chips! You can use dark or milk chocolate chips if you prefer.</li>
            </ul>
