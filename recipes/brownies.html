            <h2>Ingredients:</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>Sugar: These easy brownies start with two cups of white sugar.</li>
                <li>Flour: All-purpose flour creates structure in the batter.</li>
                <li>Butter: 1 cup of melted butter gives the brownies moisture and richness.</li>
                <li>Eggs: Eggs lend even more moisture. Plus, they help bind the batter together.</li>
                <li>Cocoa powder: Of course, you'll need cocoa powder for chocolate brownies!</li>
                <li>Vanilla: Vanilla extract enhances the overall flavor of the brownies.</li>
                <li>Baking powder: Baking powder acts as a leavener, which means it helps the brownies rise.</li>

            <ol>
                <li>Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease a 9x13-inch pan with baking spray.</li>
                <li>Whisk sugar, flour, melted butter, eggs, cocoa powder, vanilla, baking powder, and salt in a large bowl until combined.</li>
                <li>Spread the batter into the prepared pan.</li>
                <li>Decorate with walnut halves.</li>
                <li>Bake in the preheated oven until top is crinkled and a toothpick comes out with a few moist crumbs, about 20 to 30 minutes.</li>
                <li>Let cool completely in the pan on a wire rack before slicing into squares. Enjoy!</li>
